Statistical channel models are instrumental to design and evaluate wireless 
communication systems. In the millimeter wave bands, such models become 
acutely challenging: they must capture the delay, directions, and path gains, 
for each link and with high resolution.  Data-driven machine-learning methods 
provides an attractive methodology that entails minimal assumptions and can 
naturally capture intricate probabilistic relationships in complex 
environments.  This repository is currently in progress and will eventually 
provide tools for:

*  Parsing large quantities of ray tracing data for generating ML training 
and test datasets. 
*  Learning generative neural network for statistical models of the data.
*  Access to pre-trained models including UAV ground-to-air channels at 28 GHz.
*  Performing simple network simulation studies with these models. 

The work is partly based on
